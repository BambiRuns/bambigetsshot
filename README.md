# bambigetsshot

Welcome to Bambi Gets Shot! a lovely little linux installation tool by my own making that is intended to install various bits and bobs where and there.
This was written as an idea to make server installations easier for me during my education as a tech wizard.

This is intended to be used by me and only me, any use of it outside of that very narrow scope is on your own head.
currently it's capeable of:

Installing a LAMP stack.
Installing Wordpress.
